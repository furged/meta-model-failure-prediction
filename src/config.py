"""
Central path configuration.

Every path in the project is derived from PROJECT_ROOT, which is computed
from this file's location on disk. This means the code works no matter
which machine, OS, or working directory it's run from -- local dev,
a deploy server, a CI runner, all the same.

Nothing outside this file should ever hardcode a path. If you add a new
artifact or data file, add its path here and import it everywhere else.
